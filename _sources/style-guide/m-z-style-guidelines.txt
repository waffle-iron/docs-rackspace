## Messages
If you help write the message text for a product or you suggest edits to message text, use the guidelines in this topic.

**Note:** Change message text *only* at the request of (or as a suggestion to) the developer. When citing message text in a document, cite the text that the user sees in the product.

## Names
Do not use real or copyrighted names in examples. For example, do not use kelly.holcomb@example.com.

See the following topics for information about product names:
- [Product names and version number](#product-names-and-version-numbers)
- [Third-party names and trademarks](../terminology-guidelines.html#third-party-names-and-trademarks)

## Notes and other notation types
Notations (notes, tips, and warnings) call out important or helpful information. Use them sparingly, according to the guidelines in the following table.

```eval_rst
<<<<<<< HEAD
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Notation type
     - Description
   * - Important
     - Presents an important or essential point. As a rule, customers must pay attention to important notations to complete a task or understand a topic.
   * - Note
     - Provides information that emphasizes or supplements information in the text. A note can provide information that applies only in certain cases.
   * - Tip
     - Provides useful information that might improve product performance or make procedures easier to follow. Tips provide the following benefits: 

       • Help customers learn techniques or procedures
       • Show alternative ways of doing something 
       • Provide shortcuts 
       • Provide helpful (but not essential) information
   * - Warning
     - Alerts customers to potential hazards or highlights critical information. Use a warning for situations in which users could lose data, compromise data integrity, or disrupt operations if they do not follow instructions carefully.
=======

>>>>>>> 21df6f80aa6041095745190a81864127b7513299

```

When creating notations, use the following guidelines:

- Use the style or element in your authoring tool to create the notation. If there is no style or element, create the notation as follows: Type the word **Important**, **Note**, **Tip**, or **Warning**, follow it with a colon, make both the label and the colon bold, and then provide the text of the notation in regular font. If a notation contains more than one item (such as two notes presented in a unordered list), make the label plural (for example, **Notes**).

- Place a notation as close as possible to the information that it emphasizes or clarifies.

- Do not "stack" notations of the same type (for example, by following one labeled note directly with another labeled note). Instead, use separate paragraphs or an unordered list within a single notation. It is acceptable for notations of different types to follow one another.

## Numbers
Use the following guidelines for showing numbers in documentation.

- [Numbers versus words](#numbers-versus-words)
- [Commas in numbers](#commas-in-numbers)
- [Ranges of numbers](#ranges-of-numbers)
- [Unspecified, generic, and unknown numbers](#unspecified-generic-and-unknown-numbers)

### Numbers versus words
Spell out numbers from zero through nine, except in the cases shown in the following table. In these cases, or if the number is 10 or larger, use numerals.

```eval_rst
<<<<<<< HEAD
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50

Avoid beginning a sentence with a number. If you must begin a sentence with a number, spell out the number unless the number is part of a product, service, or company name.

```eval_rst

```

Do not use the spelled-out form of a number followed by a numeral in parentheses. However, if you think that a user might misread the numeral 0 as the letter O, you can clarify by spelling out zero parenthetically after the numeral.

```eval_rst

```

### Commas in numbers
Always use commas in numbers with four or more digits. However, do not use commas in the following types of numbers:
- Addresses
- Fractional part of a decimal number
- Page numbers
- Literal representations of user-entered values or displayed values

```eval_rst
<<<<<<< HEAD
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Do not use
   * - 9001 N IH 35 
       1,452.7532 
       page 1055 (but 1,055 pages) 
       1,024 bytes
     - 9,001 N IH 35 
       1,452.753,2 
=======
Use \| Do not use --- \| --- 9001 N IH 35

       1,024 bytes \| 9,001 N IH 35 
       1,452.753,2

>>>>>>> 21df6f80aa6041095745190a81864127b7513299
       page 1,055 
       1024 bytes

```

**Note:** Do not use European-style numbering, which uses commas in the place of periods. For example, use 3.14159, not 3,14159.

### Ranges of numbers
When describing number ranges, use the following guidelines:
- To describe an inclusive range, use *through*. When space is limited, use an en dash instead. Do not use the word *inclusive* in your description.

- Use prepositions as follows:
  - If you use *between* to introduce a range, use *and* to conclude the range. Using *between* and *and* implies a noninclusive range.
  - If you use *from* to introduce a range, use *through* or *to* to conclude the range.
  - Do not mix *between* or *from* with an en dash.

```eval_rst

```

### Unspecified, generic, and unknown numbers
To represent an unspecified or generic number, use *n* as the variable and apply italics.

To represent an unspecified or unknown version number, use *x* for each digit and apply italics.

```eval_rst
<<<<<<< HEAD
.. list-table::
   :widths: 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
   * - Move the insertion point *n* spaces to the right.

>>>>>>> 21df6f80aa6041095745190a81864127b7513299

```

## Parameters
When documenting parameters, observe the following guidelines:

- In request and response examples, show all of the parameters.

- Describe all of the parameters in tables preceding the examples. Observe the following guidelines for writing descriptions:

  - Provide meaningful information about the parameter; don't just repeat the parameter's name. Link to other sections of the documentation if more explanation is needed or if the list of possible values is long.

  - Write the first sentence of a description with an implied subject. For example, if the parameter is `name`, the description might be "Server name, which becomes the initial host name of the server."

  - Include any valid values and default value at the end of the description. Use the formats "Valid values are *n* and *n*." and "The default is *n*." For example, "Valid values are `true` and `false`." and "The default is `false`."

- For request body parameters only, label the required parameters by adding the *(Required)* qualifier to the beginning of the description. For example:

  *(Required)* Path of the parameter to update. Valid values are `/enabled`, `/vault/region`, `/vault/use_internal`, and `/log-level`.

  Do not label optional request body parameters. Also, do not label URI, query, or response body parameters as either optional or required.

- When listing and describing request and response body parameters in tables, show the parameters in the same order as they are shown in the examples. If you have more than one example, match the order in the first example shown.

- Format parameter names in text according to the guidelines in [Text formatting](#text-formatting).

## Placeholder (variable) text
Placeholder text (also referred to as variable text or replaceable text) stands for an object whose specific name is unknown to us. Placeholders are included when documenting syntax for how a command or path should be constructed. Customers supply the relevant value for the placeholder when using the command or syntax.

Placeholder text usually indicates the type of element that is being represented. For example, *directoryName* would likely indicate the name of a directory.

**Note:** Placeholder text is distinct from *environment variables*. Environment variables have established formats and names, such as `$account`, and their values are set in the system by customers and used consistently. By contrast, a placeholder is given a relevant value by the customer at the time that the customer runs the code or types the path. For information about formatting environment variables, see [Text formatting](#text-formatting).

When creating placeholder text, use the following guidelines.

**Note:** For specific information about showing placeholders for account information such as account numbers, user names, passwords, and API keys, see [Cloud account information](../a-l-style-guidelines.html#cloud-account-information).

```eval_rst
<<<<<<< HEAD
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Guidelines
     - Example
   * - Show placeholder text in italics. 

       If you need to make placeholders more visible in code that customers are expected to copy and use, apply bold as well as italic. For information about applying formatting, see `Text formatting <#text-formatting>`__. 

       If you cannot apply text formatting to the code, enclose placeholders in punctuation that does not have any other special use in the code. For example, use angle brackets or curly braces. Use a consistent convention throughout the documentation set.
     - ``nova boot <serverName> --image <image> --flavor <flavor> --nic net-id=net1_id``
   * - Use lowercase letters except when showing a multiple-word placeholder.

       To show a multiple-word placeholder, do not separate the words with spaces or symbols. To distinguish the words in the placeholder, capitalize the first letter of each word after the first word (called camelCase). Do not capitalize the first word. 

       **Note:** Use lowercase and camelCase unless you have to follow the conventions of the programming language. For example, you might need to use underscores (account\_ID) or all capitals (ACCOUNT\_ID).
     - *password* 
       *serverName* 
       *apiKey* 
       *tenantId*
   * - In general, use one or more whole words to represent a placeholder. Do not sacrifice clarity for brevity. Create placeholders that are descriptive and meaningful.
     - *device* (instead of *dev*) 

       *installationDirectory* (instead of *installDir*) 

       *mode* (instead of *########*)

When explaining a placeholder, use the following guidelines.

```eval_rst
<<<<<<< HEAD
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Guidelines
     - Example
   * - Avoid stand-alone clauses that begin with *where*. Instead, use a sentence.
     - *Use:* 
       **https://dfw.bigdata.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0/yourAccountId/** 

       *yourAccountId* is your actual account number, which is returned as part of the authentication service response. 
       
       *Avoid:* 
       **https://dfw.bigdata.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0/yourAccountId/** 

       where *yourAccountId* is your actual account number, which is returned as part of the authentication service response.
   * - If you need to explain two or more placeholders, use an unordered list.
     - From a supported web browser, type the following URL:

       **http://hostName:portNumber/ed/index.html** 

       The placeholders in the URL are defined as follows:

       • *hostName* is the name of the host computer on which the application server is installed. 

       • *portNumber* is the port number assigned to the application server. The default is 8082.
   * - Show the placeholder in regular text with the same formatting that it is shown in the path or code. For example, if you can show it in italics, use italics when explaining it. If you first show the placeholder in a code block and need to enclose it in angle brackets, show it in angle brackets and monospace when explaining it.
     - *Use:* 
       **https://dfw.bigdata.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0/yourAccountId/**

   * - Guideline
     - Example
   * - To form the plural of an abbreviation, an acronym, or a number, add a lowercase *s* without an apostrophe.

       If an acronym already represents a plural noun, do not add an *s*. 

       **Note:** To refer to more than one FAQ document or section, add the appropriate noun after *FAQ* and make the noun plural—for example, *FAQ articles*. Follow this guideline for other plural acronyms when you need to refer to more than one instance of them.
     - CPUs, APIs, IDs, OSs, the 1990s, 0s and 1s 

       frequently asked questions (FAQ)
   * - To form the plural of a single letter or a symbol, add an apostrophe and a lowercase *s*.
     - x's, #'s
   * - Abbreviated units of measure are both singular and plural; no *s* is necessary.
     - 5 mm, 20 in., 20 min
   * - Do not use *(s)*, */s*, *(es)*, or */es* at the end of a word to indicate the possibility of more than one item, and do not combine the singular and plural forms of a verb, such as *is/are*. Use the singular form or the plural form, use both forms joined by a conjunction, or use the phrase *one or more*.

## Product names and version numbers
When using Rackspace product names and showing version numbers, observe the following guidelines:

- Always spell out and properly capitalize Rackspace product and service names (for example, Cloud Servers and Cloud Files).

- In some cases, you can refer to the product generically after using the product name. For example, after you introduce the Cloud Monitoring Agent, you can refer to simply *the agent*.

- Do not capitalize an item that a user creates through a Rackspace service. For example, users use the Cloud Servers service to create a *server*, not a *Server*, and they use the Cloud Load Balancer service to create a *load balancer*, not a *Load Balancer*.

- Do not abbreviate Rackspace names, unless the abbreviation has been approved by the Legal and Marketing departments. For example, never abbreviate Cloud Block Storage as CBS.

- For API documentation, the version number in the documentation should match the version number of the software. The combination of the API version number and the publication date identify the document version.

When using third-party company and product names, use the name as it is used by the third-party. For a list of commonly used third-party names, see [Third-party names and trademarks](../terminology-guidelines.html#third-party-names-and-trademarks).

When referring to an OpenStack service, use the actual service name, and provide the project name in parentheses. For example, use OpenStack Block Storage (Cinder). On subsequent references, use the service name instead of the project name, unless you need to use project names to differentiate between two versions of one service. See the [OpenStack documentation conventions](http://docs.openstack.org/contributor-guide/writing-style/openstack-components.html) for service and project names.

### Colons
Use the following guidelines for colons.

```eval_rst
<<<<<<< HEAD
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Guideline
     - Example
   * - Use a colon at the end of a sentence that introduces a list. If another sentence intervenes between the introductory sentence and the list, use a period instead of a colon. 

       **Note:** Use a sentence, rather than a fragment, to introduce a list. Fragments are difficult to translate and can be harder to comprehend than sentences, so avoid using them to introduce lists.
     - The following monitoring checks are available to users: 

       You can use this product to perform the following tasks: 

       You can use this product to perform the following tasks. You must extract objects from the database to complete these tasks.
   * - In steps, use a colon to introduce code that the user is expected to enter.
     - Run the following command: 
       ``nova list``
   * - Do not use a colon to end the introduction to a table, figure, or example.
     - The following figure shows an overview of Cloud Databases infrastructure. 

       In the following request example, ``Content-Type`` is set to ``application/json``, but ``application/xml`` is requested in the ``Accept`` header. 

       Table 5.1 lists the endpoints to use for your Cloud Databases API calls.

### Dashes
An *em dash* is the longest dash. Use em dashes sparingly, and mostly in the following situations:

- In a list item, if you need to separate an initial term or phrase from the information that follows it, use an em dash with no spaces on either side of it.

- You can use em dashes to set off a long qualifier in the middle of a sentence if the use of commas would hinder readability. If you do use em dashes for this purpose, do not use spaces around them.

Do not use an em dash to separate a long sentence into two parts. Instead, create two sentences. In most cases, other forms of punctuation are more effective for clarity.

An *en dash* is longer than a hyphen and shorter than an em dash. Use an en dash for the following purposes:

- To show a range of numbers in a table or figure

  **Note:** To show a range of numbers in text, use *to* or *through* instead of an en dash.
- To represent a minus sign

- To indicate a negative number

- To join the elements of a compound modifier when one of the elements is an open compound (a combination of words that constitutes a single concept, like Customer Support).

```

### Ellipses
An ellipsis (...) is a punctuation construct that is used in syntax or to indicate omitted code in technical content. For technical writing, an ellipsis is used only in code examples.

Do not use an ellipsis in the following cases:

- When showing the name of an interface element such as a text box, menu, menu command, or command button, even if the ellipsis is displayed on the interface
- When writing header text for table columns and rows

The following example shows acceptable use of an ellipsis in a code sample:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Location: /v1/queues/fizbat/messages?ids=50b68a50d6f5b8c8a7c62b01,

"ttl": 800,
"age": 32,
"body": {
"cmd": "EncodeVideo",
"jobid": 58229
}
},
```
The following examples show when *not* to use ellipses:

On the **File** menu, click **Open...**. 
      
Do this ... *(column header)*

### Exclamation points
Avoid using exclamation points. For more information, see [Use interjections with care](../basic-writing-guidelines.html#use-interjections-with-care).

### Hyphens
This section provides general guidelines for hyphenation. For guidelines about using dashes, see [Dashes](#dashes).

- [Hyphens in compound modifiers](#hyphens-in-compound-modifiers)
- [Hyphens with prefixes](#hyphens-with-prefixes)

#### Hyphens in compound modifiers
When two or more words precede and modify a noun as a unit (also called a *compound modifier*), use hyphens according to the following guidelines.

```eval_rst
<<<<<<< HEAD
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Guideline
     - Example
   * - To clarify meaning, use a hyphen.
     - *Ambiguous:* 
       high level language compiler 
       (a language compiler that is high level or a compiler of high-level languages?) 

       *Clear:* 
       high-level-language compiler 
       (clearly a compiler of high-level languages)
   * - Words that you hyphenate as compound modifiers preceding a noun might not be hyphenated in other parts of a sentence or when used as another part of speech. Hyphenate only if needed for clarity. 
       
       **Note:** One exception is *up-to-date*, which is hyphenated in any position in a sentence.
     - local-level attributes 
       attributes that are defined at the local level 

       up-to-date content 
       content is up-to-date
   * - If the first component of a compound modifier is a number, use a hyphen.
     - 32-bit operating system 
       three-tier architecture 
       80-character line length 
       3.5-inch disk
   * - If the first word of a compound modifier is an adverb ending in *-ly*, do not hyphenate the modifier.
     - newly designed interface 
       recently upgraded product 
       fully qualified domain name
   * - If one of the elements of a compound modifier is an open compound (multiple words that constitute a single concept, like Customer Support), use an en dash, not a hyphen, to separate the open compound from the rest of the modifier.
     - Customer Support–related queries
   * - If one of the elements of a compound modifier is a trademark, do not hyphenate the modifier.
     - *Use:* 
       specific to Java 
       Java specific 

       *Do not use:*

#### Hyphens with prefixes
Words with prefixes are not usually hyphenated. However, a hyphen might be necessary in the following cases:

- You need to distinguish between homographs, such as *re-create* and *recreate*.

- The last letter of the prefix and the first letter of the root word are the same.
Exceptions are words such as *reenter* and *preemptive*, which are not likely to be misread.

- The prefix precedes a proper noun or a number, as in *non-Boolean* and *pre-2000*.

- The product team has hyphenated a term with a prefix, and you need to follow suit in the docs for consistency with the interface—for example, *multi-factor authentication* in the Identity product. Whenever possible, work with the teams to use preferred spelling.

For the correct formatting of a specific word, see a dictionary or [Terminology](terminology-guidelines.md). For more information about hyphenating prefixes, see *The Chicago Manual of Style*.

### Parentheses
Avoid parentheses in running text. Parenthetical text can distract the reader from the main idea of the sentence and disrupt the flow of the sentence. When possible, put parenthetical information in a separate sentence.

Following are some acceptable uses for parentheses:

- To define an abbreviation
- To show a special character
- To show an equivalent measurement
- To show examples
- To show a concise phrase that qualifies a term, title, or step

Do not add *(s)* or *(es)* to the end of a noun to indicate the possibility of more than one item. Use the singular form or the plural form, or use both forms joined by a conjunction.

   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Guideline
     - Example
   * - Use quotation marks in user entries or syntax only if the software requires the quotation marks.
     - Replace the text inside of the quotation marks on the ``AuthName`` line to the name of your password protected area. For example, type ``"My Password Protected Directory"``.
   * - Use quotation marks in message text only if the product shows quotation marks in the generated message. Use code font (monospace) to format messages.
     - The message ``Press "Enter" to continue`` is displayed in the lower-right corner.
   * - If you use a term in a unique or qualified sense, use double quotation marks in text only at its first occurrence, and omit the quotation marks in subsequent occurrences of the term.
     - The spelling checker "learns" the word. After it learns the word, the spelling checker ignores subsequent occurrences of the word in the document.
   * - When referring to a section of a web page, enclose the section title in parentheses if you cannot create a link.
     - For information about patents, see the "Resources and Tools" section of the `Racklaw website <https://inside.rackspace.com/web/racklaw/ip>`__.
   * - Include appropriate punctuation, such as periods and commas, inside quotation marks unless the quotation marks are part of the syntax that the user must type. 

       For more information about using quotation marks with other marks of punctuation, see *The Chicago Manual of Style*.
     - For more information, see "Trademarks."

### Semicolons
Avoid using semicolons, which are often misused and even when used correctly can make sentences longer and more difficult to understand.
- Instead of connecting independent clauses with a semicolon, break them into separate sentences.
- Instead of connecting more than two items with semicolons, create a list.

### Slashes
Do not use a slash mark (/) to present a choice among, or a series of, actions or objects. Rewrite the phrase to eliminate the slash mark. Exceptions are established terms like *client/server* and *read/write*.

Do not use a slash in dates. For information about how to format dates, see [Dates](../a-l-style-guidelines.html#dates).

## Tables
Often text that is difficult to read in paragraph form is clear when put into a table. Tables clarify the relationships among information, and they are easy to scan. This topic provides the guidelines for the following aspects of tables:

- [Introductory text for tables](#introductory-text-for-tables)
- [Table titles (captions)](#table-titles-captions)
- [Column and row headers](#column-and-row-headers)
- [Table text](#table-text)
- [Table footnotes](#table-footnotes)
- [Attribute or parameter tables in API documents](#attribute-or-parameter-tables-in-API-documents)

Table examples are presented in a separate section at the end of this topic.

**Note:** Do not create tables that are overly complex or that scroll horizontally. If you find that you have too much information in a table, try to break it up into smaller tables.

### Introductory text for tables
In the text that precedes a table, introduce the table in a way that relates the table to the text. If the table immediately follows the reference to it, use a generic reference (such as *the following table*) even if the table has a title. Provide a link to a table title only when the table does not immediately follow the reference or when the table is in a different article or section.

To introduce a table, use a sentence (not a fragment), and end it in a period (not a colon).

### Table titles (captions)
Tables should normally have titles (captions). However, some tables are closely associated with the surrounding text and do not require titles. For example, decision matrixes and tables within tasks, procedures, and tutorials do not require numbers or titles.

When creating table titles, use the following guidelines:
- Use sentence-style capitalization for table titles. However, for words that are always uppercase or always lowercase, match that case.
- Do not start a table title with an article (*a*, *an*, *the*).
- Do not end a table title with a period or colon.
- Place the title above the table, not below it, and tag it as bold.
- Do not manually number table titles. If titles should be numbered, the style sheet will number them.
- Make table titles concise; limit them to one line if possible.
- Make table titles descriptive:
  - Avoid using a table title that duplicates a topic or section title.
  - Ensure that no two table titles in an article are identical. To distinguish between the titles that are similar, add qualifiers.
- Do not include trademark symbols in table titles.

### Column headers
Use the following guidelines for text in column headers:

- Use [sentence-style capitalization](../a-l-style-guidelines.html#cap-sentence-style) in column headers. However, for words that are always uppercase or always lowercase, match that case.
- Use singular nouns for column headers, unless the context requires otherwise.
- Do not end column headers with ellipses or colons.

### Table text
Use the following guidelines for text in table cells:

- Use the same punctuation and capitalization guidelines that you use for [text in lists](../a-l-style-guidelines.html#lists).
- Make the entries in a table parallel. For example, in a column that describes options, be consistent in beginning the entries with a verb or noun.
- Avoid leaving a table cell blank. If no information is available for that cell, use *Not applicable* or *None*. Use the abbreviation *NA* only if space constraints exist. Do not use dashes. An exception is for matrix-type tables that use an X or other marker to indicate support. In such cases, blank cells are acceptable (see the third example in the sidebar).
- When showing a notation in a table, use the guidelines in [Notes and other notation types](#notes-and-other-notation-types).
- If space in a table is constrained, you can use abbreviations and symbols that you would not normally use in body text (such as % for percent).
- Do not use color to differentiate table text.

### Table footnotes
If a notation (for example, a note or warning) applies to the entire table, place the content in a regular notation preceding the table. If a notation applies only to the content in a certain cell, place the notation in that cell. However, if a notation applies to all of the content in a row or column, or to the content in two or more cells, you can use footnotes.

- When writing the text of table footnotes, use the following guidelines:
  - Ensure that all footnotes are written clearly and completely. Use sentences when possible. Avoid cryptic language.
  - Ensure that all footnotes have parallel grammatical structure (sentences are paralleled by sentences, phrases by phrases, and so on).
- Place the footnote text at the end of the table, either in a final row that spans the entire table or under the last row in the table.
- Use superscript numbers to indicate the footnotes in the cells to which they apply. If numbers might be confusing (for example, because the text in the cells are numerical values), use lowercase letters instead.
  - A footnote cited in a column header applies to the entire column.
  - A footnote cited in a table cell applies to the text in that cell. Use a cell-level footnote if the note applies to multiple cells in the table.

### Attribute or parameter tables in API documents
When creating attribute or parameter tables in API documents, use the following additional guidelines:

- For tables that describes JSON or XML attributes, write the first sentence of a description with an implied subject. For example, if the attribute is name, the description might be as follows: "Server name, which becomes the initial host name of the server"
- For attributes, include the valid values and default value at the end of the description. Use the formats "Valid values are *n* and *n*." and "The default is *n*." For example, "Valid values are `true` and `false`." and "The default is `false`."
- If table descriptions or construction is complex, consider using a definition list or itemized list instead of a table.
- Avoid putting definition lists in tables.

     - The name of the object or objects in Swift to be referenced. Although Swift doesn't support paths, swiftfs attempts to interpret names that look like paths and behave appropriately. For example, an input path named ``/path/to/*`` would qualify all objects with names prefixed by ``/path/to/``. Similarly, an output path of ``/path/to/`` would prefix the names of all newly created objects with ``/path/to/``.

## Tasks and procedures
A *task* is a job that customers perform to achieve a goal, such as creating a server. A task is made up of a number of elements, including procedures, which are sets of sequential action steps. A task topic, article, or section focuses on the customer’s task. It provides the action steps and the essential supporting information (context and reference) that the customer needs to complete the task.

This topic provides guidelines for developing task topics and procedures.

- [Task titles](#tasks-titles)
- [Task introductions](#task-introductions)
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Procedural steps](#procedural-steps)
- [Results, verification, examples, and troubleshooting](#results-verification-examples-and-troubleshooting)
- [Direction to the next action](#direction-to-the-next-action)
- [Related topics](#related-topics)

### Task titles
The title of a task topic, article, or section begins with the imperative form of the task action and uniquely, precisely, and clearly describes the task. Use a plural subject unless the singular makes more sense or is necessary for clarity.

```eval_rst

```

For guidelines about capitalizing titles, see [Capitalization](../a-l-style-guidelines.html#capitalization).

### Task introductions
Before providing steps, set the context for the task as necessary. For example, briefly state the reason for completing the task, the method to be used, and the expected result. You might also suggest the amount of time that the task should take, especially if it will take a long time.

A simple task might require only one or two sentences of introduction and a single set of steps. However, a complex task might require several procedures and even reference material. In the latter case, you can include the following kinds of information in the introduction:

- High-level description of the associated tasks and their relationships, including a forecast of the upcoming actions
- Common requirements for the tasks
- High-level sequence of events
- Flow chart
- Hyperlinks to material that the customer needs to review
- Knowledge requirements for customers

**Notes:**
- If the article or section title provides sufficient context, you can omit an introduction.
- Avoid providing extensive overview or conceptual text in the introduction to a task. Provide that information in a separate concept topic or in a topic that introduces the task as part of a larger process or customer goal.

### Prerequisites
If the task has requirements that the customer *must* meet before taking action, describe these in a "Prerequisites" section that precedes the procedure. You might include the following information:

- A hyperlink to a preceding task, if that task must be performed before this task
- Software that must already be installed, accessible, or running
- Access rights that are required for customers to perform the task
- Hyperlinks to other topics that contain requirements or prerequisite tasks that the customer must perform

**Note:** Avoid including detailed procedures in a prerequisites section. Provide prerequisite tasks in other articles or sections, which you can reference in this section.

### Procedural steps
A task contains one or more procedures, or sets of sequential action steps. Consider the following guidelines when creating a procedure:

- If the procedure has more than one step, use a numbered list for the steps. Do not use bullets, except to list choices within a step.
- If the procedure has only one step, show that step in a regular paragraph. That is, do not number it.
- If you have lengthy introductory or prerequisite information, or if you have more than one procedure, provide a heading for the procedure or procedures. Use the imperative form of the action and a singular form of the object. Do not repeat the title of the task article.
- Try to limit procedures to 10 steps. If you have more than 10 steps, consider whether you can divide the steps into two or more procedures. Creating several short, simple, and sequential procedures instead on one long, complex procedure, especially one with many substeps and choice steps, will help customers know where they are in the process, judge their progress, and complete the task successfully.

When writing steps, use the following guidelines.

- [Use imperative sentences](#use-imperative-sentences)
- [Show one action per step](#show-one-action-per-step)
- [Use consistent verbs](#use-consistent-verbs)
- [Provide context before the action](#provide-context-before-the-action)
- [Provide conditions before actions](#provide-conditions-before-actions)
- [Follow the step with explanatory information](#follow-the-step-with-explanatory-information)
- [Show only actions as steps](#show-only-actions-as-steps)
- [Use screenshots sparingly](#use-screenshots-sparingly)
- [Label optional steps](#label-optional-steps)
- [Omit extraneous words](#omit-extraneous-words)
- [Show multiple conditions in a list](#show-multiple-conditions-in-a-list)
- [Show multiple possibilities in a list](#show-multiple-possibilities-in-a-list)
- [Document only one method](#document-only-one-method)

#### Use imperative sentences
Write each step as a complete and correctly punctuated imperative sentence (that is, a sentence that starts with an imperative verb). In steps, the [focus](../basic-writing-guidelines.html#write-to-user) is on the customer, and the [voice](../basic-writing-guidelines.html#use-active-voice) is active.

**Examples**

1. Log in to the Cloud Control Panel.


1. Use the following command to start `vsftpd`:

    `sudo service vsftpd start`

#### Show one action per step
Usually, include only a single action in each step. If two actions are closely related, such as opening a menu and selecting a command from the menu, you can include both actions in one step.

**Examples**

*Use:*

1. Under **Export**, select your database (for example, 388488_drupal).
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the window and select the **Save as file** check box, which will save your database output to a file.
3. Click **Go**.
4. If you are prompted to save your file, save it to your computer.

*Do not use:*

Under **Export**, select your database (for example, 388488_drupal). Scroll down to the bottom of the window and select the **Save as file** check box, which will save your database output to a file. Finally click **Go**. If you are prompted to save your file, save it somewhere on your computer.

#### Use consistent verbs
Use the following action verbs consistently:
- *Click*, to refer to command buttons, hyperlinks, icons, and tabs
- *Select*, to refer to items that the customer can select from a list, option buttons, menu commands, and menu sequences
- *Select* and *clear*, to refer to check boxes

**Example**

1. On the Binding and SSL Settings page, perform the following steps:
  1. Select an IP address, or select the default value of **All Unassigned**.
  2. Select the **Start FTP site automatically** check box.
  3. Select **Allow SSL**.
  4. Click **Next**.

#### Provide context before the action
If a step specifies where to perform an action, state where to perform the action before describing the action.

**Examples**

1. In the navigation pane, click **Inbound Rules**.


1. On the Binding and SSL Settings page, perform the following steps:

#### Provide conditions before actions
If a step specifies a situation or a condition, state the situation or condition before describing the action.

**Examples**

1.  If a new version is available, click **Install**.


1. To find out the encryption type of your Windows computer (32-bit or 64-bit), navigate to the server's Control Panel and click **System**.

#### Follow the step with explanatory information
Do not include explanatory or reference information in the action part of a step. If needed, follow the step with one or more paragraphs that provide supplemental information.

**Examples**

1. In the **Body Match** text box, enter a word or phrase that will appear on the page when it loads successfully.

  For example, you can perform a body match on the copyright date to verify whether the website is running.

#### Show only actions as steps
Do not document system actions, responses, or results as steps. Put necessary statements in paragraphs following the steps to which they apply. See the first *Use/Do not use* example in the "Examples" section.

When the result of a step is the appearance of a dialog box, window, or page in which the action of the next steps occurs, you can usually eliminate a result statement and orient the customer at the beginning of the next step. See the second *Use/Do not use* example in the "Examples" section. However, include results statements when the results are not obvious or you think that customers need a checkpoint in a procedure.

**Examples**

*Use:*

1. On Linux, enter the following command:

    `sudo rackspace-monitoring-agent --setup`

  The list of setup settings is displayed.

*Do not use:*

1. On Linux, enter the following command:

    `sudo rackspace-monitoring-agent --setup`

2. The list of setup settings is displayed.

*Use:*

1. Under **Other Options** in the Rackspace Email box, select **Mobile Sync**.
2. On the Activate Mobile Sync page, select individual users to activate, or select the **Add Mobile Sync to all mailboxes on this domain** option.

*Avoid:*

1. Under **Other Options** in the Rackspace Email box, select **Mobile Sync**.

  The Activate Mobile Sync page is displayed.

2. Select individual users to activate, or select the **Add Mobile Sync to all mailboxes on this domain** option.

#### Use screenshots sparingly
Screenshots can help to orient the customer, but a screenshot of every field or dialog box is usually not necessary.

If you include screenshots, place each one directly under the step that it illustrates. Do not rely on the screenshot to show information or values that the user must enter; always provide that information in the text of the steps. However, ensure that the screenshot accurately reflects the directions and values in the step text.

#### Label optional steps
To indicate that a step is optional, include *(Optional)*, in italics, as a qualifier at the beginning of the step.

**Example**

1. *(Optional)* Click **Advanced Options**.

#### Omit extraneous words
Omit extraneous words (such as *pop-up menu* or *command button*) unless the omission sacrifices clarity.

**Examples**

*Use:*

1. In the Disks window, right-click the volume and select **Take Offline**.

*Avoid:*

1. In the Disks window, right-click the volume and select **Take Offline** from the pop-up menu.

*Use:*

1. Click **Add**, enter a name for the profile, and then click **OK**.

*Avoid:*

1. Click the **Add** button, enter a name for the profile in the text box, and then click the **OK** button.

#### Show multiple conditions in a list

If the action of a step varies depending on multiple conditions, use an unordered list to present the conditions.

**Example**

1. At the next prompt, associate one of the listed Cloud Monitoring entities with the agent:

  - If only one entity is listed, select option 1.
  - If more than one entity is listed, choose the entity that most closely matches your server based on the IP addresses listed.

#### Show multiple possibilities in a list
If a step directs the customer to choose from multiple possibilities, use an unordered list to present the possibilities.

**Example**

1. Select a volume type:

  - **Standard**: A standard SATA drive for customers who need additional storage on their server
  - **High Performance**: An SSD drive, which offers a higher performance option for databases and high performance applications

#### Document only one method
If more than one method exists for completing an action, document only one method, usually the most efficient or preferred method.

**Example**

*Use:*

1. Select **File > New**.

*Do not use:*

1. Select **File > New**, or press **Ctrl+N**.

### Results, verification, examples, and troubleshooting
Following the procedure or procedures, include the following information if it is necessary or helpful to the customer. If the information is brief, you can include it directly following the last step in the procedure. If it is lengthy or you need to provide more than one type of information, use sections with headings.

- The result of performing the task.
- Information about verifying successful completion of the task, such as the location of logs. If verification is a separate task in a different article or section, provide a hyperlink to it under a "Where to go from here" heading.
- An example that illustrates or supports the task.
- Information about what to do if the procedure does not work. This information might be a hyperlink to a troubleshooting topic.

### Direction to the next action
If your task is part of a larger set of tasks, you can help the customer by including a "Where to go from here" section. You might include the following information:

- A brief explanation of the next task and why the customer needs to perform it, accompanied by a hyperlink to the next task.
- Hyperlinks to other tasks that could be done next, if multiple options are available. Describe the multiple options so that customers know which task to choose.

### Related topics
To provide a quick way for the customer to access other content that is related to the task, provide links to the content at the end of the article or topic. Even if you have already included an embedded hyperlink to the material in the article or topic, you can provide the hyperlink again under "Related topics," but typically you should provide a link only once in an article or section. For more information about linking, see [Links and cross-references](../a-l-style-guidelines.html#links-and-cross-references).

## Telephone numbers
Use the following guidelines for telephone numbers:

Use a space, not hyphens or dashes, to separate parts of the telephone number.

```

Precede US and Canadian telephone numbers with 1. Precede all other telephone numbers with a plus sign.

```eval_rst
<<<<<<< HEAD
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

       +45 7734 5764

```

If you are showing phone numbers in screenshots or in examples, use the following guidelines:

- Do not use any number that might be a real telephone number. Instead, use a number in the range 555-0100 through 555-0199; these numbers are reserved for fictional use. You can also use a number that belongs to Rackspace.
- If a screenshot includes a nonfictional, non Rackspace number, mask out all or parts of it.

## Text formatting
Certain text should be formatted differently from the surrounding text to designate a special meaning or to make the text stand out to the customer. Usually this formatting is accomplished by applying a different font treatment (bold, italics, or monospace).

**Note:** *Monospace* is also called a *fixed-pitch* or *fixed-width* font. In monospace, each letter and character occupy the same amount of horizontal space. An example of a monospace font is Courier, and it looks as follows: `monospace font`.

Observe the following general guidelines when formatting text:

- To apply a font treatment, use the appropriate markup in your authoring tool.
- Do not apply font treatments to text elements in titles and headings.
- Do not use capitalization to emphasize a term (for example, showing a general term in all capitals). Follow the capitalization that is normally used for a term, or follow the capitalization guidelines in the following table. For more information, see [Capitalization](../a-l-style-guidelines.html#capitalization).
- Do not use color alone to distinguish text. Color is powerful but unreliable. Not everyone can see every color, most people do not print using color, and monitors and browsers limit themselves to color subsets. Also, people can personalize their displays to override your color selections.
- Use quotation marks only as directed in this topic and in [Quotation marks](#quotation-marks).

The conventions are divided into tables based on the content in which they would most likely be used. If you can't find what you are looking for in one table, be sure to look in the others.

- [Conventions for common items](#conventions-for-common-items)
- [Conventions for API and CLI](#conventions-for-api-and-cli)
- [Conventions for UI](#conventions-for-ui)

### Conventions for common items
The following table lists formatting conventions for items that might appear in content that documents a UI, CLI, or API.

## Time
You can show time by using either the 12-hour or 24-hour clock. The preferred format for international audiences, and the format used in most computer systems, is the 24-hour clock. Use the 24-hour clock when possible. If the technology or interface that you are documenting shows or uses the 12-hour clock, then be consistent with the interface.

### 24-hour clock
When you use the 24-hour clock to show time, use the following guidelines:

- Separate the hours, minutes, and seconds by using a colon.
- Show the hours, minutes, and second with two digits each, even if the leading digit is 0.
- If you need to show a time zone, use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and indicate the time-zone offset from UTC.

```

### 12-hour clock
When you use the 12-hour clock to show time, use the following guidelines:

- Separate the hours and minutes by using a colon. If the minutes are 00, you do not need to show them unless you are showing a span of time that includes a time with minutes.
- Use lowercase letters for abbreviations of ante meridiem (a.m.) and post meridiem (p.m.). Separate these abbreviation from the time with a space. Use periods in the abbreviations.
- When specifying time zones, show both the spelled-out name and the abbreviation. Show the name in lowercase letters; use uppercase letters and no periods for the abbreviation.
- Avoid references to standard and daylight saving time because the appropriate designation changes frequently. However, if you need to include such a reference, insert *S* (for standard) or *D* (for daylight) as the second character in the abbreviation.
- When referring to 12 a.m., use *12 midnight* or just *midnight*. When referring to 12 p.m., use *12 noon* or just *noon*.

## Titles and headings
This topic provides guidelines for creating titles and headings in documentation.

- [Capitalization of titles and headings](#capitalization-of-titles-and-headings)
- [Article titles and headings](#article-titles-and-headings)
- [API content titles and headings](#api-content-titles-and-headings)
- [Tables of contents](#tables-of-contents)
- [Table, figure, and example titles](#table-figure-and-example-titles)
- [Text following titles and headings](#text-following-titles-and-headings)

### Capitalization of titles and headings
Use *sentence-style capitalization* for most titles and headings, including article, chapter, table, figure, and example titles, as well as section and procedure headings. One exception is book titles, which use *title-style capitalization*.

For capitalization guidelines, see [Capitalization](../a-l-style-guidelines.html#capitalization).

### Article titles and headings
This section provides guidelines for titles of articles and headings within articles. For capitalization guidelines, see [Capitalization of titles and headings](#capitalizatin-of-titles-and-headings).

- [Titles of articles](#titles-of-articles)
- [Headings in articles](#headings-in-articles)

#### Titles of articles
Observe the following guidelines when you are creating titles for stand-alone articles on the Support site or in other collections of documentation:

- Create succinct, meaningful, descriptive titles that do not rely on body text or other titles for their meaning (that are, in other words, independent of context). Users should be able to tell from a title whether the information in the article is relevant to their needs. Avoid ambiguous one-word titles, such as "Overview."

- Place the most important words first in a title.

- Create unique titles for all of the articles within a documentation collection. To differentiate between titles that would otherwise be identical, add qualifiers either grammatically (for example, by adding a prepositional phrase) or by setting them off with a colon.

- Do not number titles to indicate their placement in a series of articles. Indicate the order of articles *within* the content of the article, referring users to information that they should have read previously before reading the current article. Use links to provide navigation to preceding and following articles in the series.

- Do not end a title with punctuation, except a question mark (when appropriate).

- Avoid "telegraphic" language (in which omitted items, such as articles, can make text cryptic). Include articles, prepositions, and punctuation as needed for clarity. However, avoid using an article (*a*, *an*, or *the*) as the first word in a title.

- Avoid showing both an abbreviation and its spelled-out term in a title. To help control the length of titles, show the abbreviation in the title and then define it in the first paragraph of the article.

- If you show a literal term (such as a command or option name) in a title, follow it with an appropriate noun.

- Do not include trademark symbols in titles. Show the symbol on the first use of the trademark in text.

- Use a consistent grammatical structure for titles of specific types of articles:

```eval_rst
<<<<<<< HEAD
.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 33 33
   :header-rows: 1

#### Headings in articles
Observe the following guidelines when you are creating headings within articles:

- Start with the highest level of heading that is approved for headings (for example, h3), and do not skip heading levels. Exceptions are made for questions within FAQ topics or terms within glossaries, which can use lower-level headings for formatting.

- Avoid using more than two levels of heading within an article. If you use more than two levels of heading, consider whether the article is complex enough to be divided into two or more articles.

- Do not use a heading as the first text in an article. Body text must intervene between the article title and the first heading.

- Do not "stack" headings. Text should always intervene between headings. Ensure that such text is meaningful. If it is just filler text, consider whether you can restructure the article.

- Avoid using only a single heading in an article. If you find that you have a single heading, consider whether you can reorganize the article to either eliminate the heading or add a second one.

- Do not apply font treatments (bold, italics, or monospace) to text in a heading.

- Do not include trademark symbols in headings. Show the symbol on the first use of the trademark in text.

- Do not end a heading with a colon or period.

- For guidelines about headings within task topics, see [Tasks and procedures](#tasks-and-procedures).

### API content titles and headings
This section provides guidelines for creating titles and headings within API content. For capitalization guidelines, see [Capitalization of titles and headings](#capitalization-of-titles-and-headings).

- [Book titles](#book-titles)
- [Section titles and headings](#section-titles-and-headings)

#### Book titles
Use title-style capitalization for titles that indicate a traditional "book" title. For example, Developer Guide. For detailed capitalization guidelines, see [Capitalization of titles and headings](#capitalization-of-titles-and-headings).

#### Section titles and headings
Observe the following guidelines when you are creating section titles and headings within sections.

- Create succinct, meaningful, descriptive titles and headings, and place the most important words first.

  - If possible, limit titles and headings to 60 characters for legibility in the TOC pane.

  - Ensure that each title and heading are unique within a given content set.

  - Consider that titles and headings are written within the context of the content set in which they are presented. Therefore, you can usually omit "context-setting" terms. For example, if the content set is about servers, you can usually omit "for servers" from the title or heading. (For example, "Attach a network to a server" can be shortened to "Attach a network" with no loss of clarity.)

- Avoid "telegraphic" language (in which omitted items, such as articles, can make text cryptic). Include articles, prepositions, and punctuation as needed for clarity. However, avoid using an article (*a*, *an*, or *the*) as the first word.

- Avoid showing both an abbreviation and its spelled-out term in a title or heading. To help control the length of titles and headings, show the abbreviation in the title or heading and then define it in the first paragraph of the section.

- If you show a literal term (such as a command or option name) in a title or heading, follow it with an appropriate noun.

- Do not end a title or heading with a colon or period. If the title or heading is in the form of a question, end it with a question mark.

- Do not apply font treatments (bold, italics, or monospace) to text in a title or heading.

- Do not include trademark symbols in titles or headings. Show the symbol on the first use of the trademark in text.

- Avoid having only a single section title or heading. If you find that you have a single section or subsection, consider whether you can reorganize the information to either eliminate the title  or heading, or add a second one.

- Avoid having more than two levels of sections. If you use more than two levels of sections, consider whether you can reorganize to make the structure flatter.

- Do not "stack" titles or headings. Text should always intervene between them. Ensure that such text is meaningful. If it is just filler text, consider whether you can restructure the content.

- Use a consistent grammatical structure for titles of specific types of sections:

```eval_rst
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

### Tables of contents

In addition to using the preceding guidelines when creating titles and headings, observe the following guidelines when creating a table of contents (TOC) for a collection of content:

- Entries in the TOC should link only to sections in the content. Do not include a link to an outside resource in the TOC.

- The text of a TOC entry must match the text of the title or heading to which it links. If the link needs to be shorter, revise the the title or heading to be shorter.

- Do not manually format the TOC. TOC formatting must be consistent and controlled by the code.

### Table, figure, and example titles
As a general rule, tables, figures, and examples should have titles (also called captions). However, tables, figures, and examples in procedures and tutorials do not normally require titles.

When creating titles for tables, figures, and examples, use the following guidelines:

- Use sentence-style capitalization. For detailed guidelines, see [Capitalization of titles and headings](#capitalization-of-titles-and-headings).

- Do not start a title with an article (*a*, *an*, or *the*).

- Do not end a title with a period.

- Place the title above the table, figure, or example, not below it.

- Make titles concise and descriptive:
  - Avoid using a title that duplicates an article or section title.
  - Ensure that no two titles are identical. To distinguish between the titles that are similar, add a qualifier.


- Do not include trademark symbols in titles.

### Text following titles and headings
Body text must follow titles and section headings. Do not follow a title or heading directly with another heading.

The body text of a section or article must be independent from the title or heading text. Don't use a title or heading as an antecedent in the sentence that follows it. Put another way, be sure to repeat the subject in the first sentence that follows the title or heading, rather than using a pronoun that refers to the title or heading as its antecedent.

## Trademarks
Using Rackspace trademarks correctly protects Rackspace brands and intellectual property, and promotes our reputation. Using third-party trademarks correctly protects Rackspace from legal action.

Rackspace Legal has created comprehensive guidelines for using trademarks at Rackspace. To get a comprehensive view of trademarks, read the [21-page PDF](https://one.rackspace.com/download/attachments/72684499/RACKSPACE-%2327629-v1-Rackspace_Trademark_Guidelines.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1387917185000&api=v2). If you are interested in only what you need to know to comply with guidelines in your documentation, review the guidelines in this topic.

### Examples of trademarks
Following are examples of Rackspace trademarks:

- Fanatical Support
- Rackspace (when used in connection with service names)
- Rackspace Managed Hosting
- RackConnect

For a complete list, see the [Rackspace Trademark List](http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/tmlist).

Following are examples of third-party trademarks that are often used in our content:
- Apache
- Enterprise Linux
- Linux
- OpenStack
- Python
- Red Hat
- SQL Server
- Ubuntu

If you need to verify whether a name is a trademark, see that company's website.

### Trademark usage guidelines
Use the following guidelines when showing Rackspace and third-party trademarks in documentation.

## URLs and domain names
Some samples, such as those related to the Customer Service Layer API, include a sample customer's URL or email address. Do not invent a fake domain name for this purpose. Even if that name is not registered today, someone might claim it tomorrow. Instead, use a domain name permanently reserved for the purpose of demonstration and documentation. **example.com** and **example.org** are reserved globally by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

Because the domain named **example.com** and the user named *Joe User* do not and never will exist, it is safe to use the email address **joe.user@example.com**.
