## Write short, concise sentences

Customers can understand wordy and complex writing, but they shouldn't be
forced to read it. Use the following guidelines to improve focus and clarity in
your content by using short sentences.

- [Use a consistent sentence structure](#use-a-consistent-sentence-structure)
- [Restrict sentence length](#restrict-sentence-length)
- [Omit unnecessary clauses, phrases, and
  words](#omit-unnecessary-clauses-phrases-and-words)
- [Put serial items into bullet lists](#put-serial-items-into-bullet-lists)

### Use a consistent sentence structure
As often as possible, use the sentence structure *subject*—*verb*—*object*. Use
simple declarative sentences for descriptions, and use simple imperative
sentences for instructions. However, you can use a sentence structure that
starts with an *if* clause or places the condition before the action.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - The value is truncated only when it is stored in an integer value.
     - Only when stored in an integer variable is the value truncated.
   * - To bake a cake, follow these steps.
     - Take a look at the following procedure below to bake a simple cake.
   * - If you must monitor clients from the host, you can configure your settings in the directory.
     - You can configure your settings in the directory if you must monitor clients from the host.

```

### Restrict sentence length

Even when a long sentence is well written, it can be harder to follow and
understand than a comparatively shorter sentence. For procedural
(task-oriented) information, try to limit sentences to 20 words. For conceptual
information, try to limit sentences to 25 words. If you must write a longer
sentence, it should have more than one clause and the relationship between the
clauses should be clear.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - After you choose a data center, the app retrieves a list of the containers that are hosted within that data center. The number of files in each container and the approximate size of each container are displayed.
     - After you choose a data center, the app retrieves a list of the containers that are hosted within that data center, along with the number of files in each container and the approximate size.
   * - Select whether to overwrite files with the same name or to restore files to their original folders. Then, click **Next**.
     - Click the check boxes to confirm whether you would like to Overwrite files with the same name or restore the files to their original folders and then click the **Next** button.

```

### Omit unnecessary clauses, phrases, and words

Ask yourself whether customers need to be told everything you are telling them.
Is anything so obvious that it does not need to be said? Are you using adverbs
(modifiers ending in *-ly*)? If so, most of them can be removed without harming
the meaning. Examine your use of adjectives. If they are not needed, remove
them. Can prepositional phrases be shortened? Are you using empty phrases that
do not clarify the content?

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - You can use the product to generate temporary URLs for files and share the files with other people.
     - A great feature implemented by the product is the ability to generate temporary URLs for files and share them with other people.
   * - Use the Control Panel to create servers easily and quickly.
     - The well-designed Control Panel is your passport to creating servers in an easy, fun way right away.
   * - SharePoint is the logical choice for business collaboration, content management, and business intelligence. You need reliable hosting, backed by solid SharePoint expertise, to keep your environment running.
     - The flexibility, extensibility, rich feature set and ease-of-use offered by SharePoint make it the logical choice for many businesses when it comes to their Collaboration, Content Management and Business Intelligence needs. As you turn to SharePoint to manage more of your business-critical processes and workflows, you need reliable SharePoint hosting, backed by solid SharePoint expertise, to keep your environment performing optimally.
   * - In an environment where the product is running, you can use the ESP utility to monitor and audit your backup and recovery activities across the enterprise.
     - In an environment where the product is installed and running on one or more hosts, the ESP utility enables you to monitor your backup and recovery activities and audit your backup and recovery practices from an enterprise-wide perspective.

```

 **Note:** Although shorter is usually better, do not omit necessary articles,
 prepositions, and connectors. Never sacrifice clarity for brevity.

### Put serial items into bullet lists

If a sentence contains a series of items, converting the items to a bullet list
often makes the sentence easier to read and easier to scan.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - The product provides the following perspectives: 

       
       -  The Development perspective contains views and editors that you use to find, create, and edit objects.
      
       - The Editorial perspective contains only those views and editors that you use to edit objects.
     - The product includes the Development perspective, which contains views and editors that you use to find, create, and update objects on servers, and the Editorial perspective, which contains just the editors and views you need when you are editing an object.
   * - From the Job Scheduler window, you can perform the following actions:

      
       - Run a generated script immediately.
      
       - Schedule a generated script to run at a later time.
      
       - Track the execution of submitted jobs.
      
       - Manage jobs in the job queue.
     - From the Job Scheduler page, you can run a generated script immediately, schedule a generated script to run at a later time, track the execution of submitted jobs, and manage jobs in the job queue.

```

## Use active voice

In general, write in *active* voice rather than *passive* voice.

- Active voice identifies the agent of action as the subject of the
  verb—usually the user.
- Passive voice identifies the recipient (not the source) of the action as the
  subject of the verb.

Active-voice sentences clarify the performer of an action and are easier to
understand than passive-voice sentences. Passive voice is usually less engaging
and more complicated than active voice. When you use passive voice, the actions
and responses of the software can be difficult to distinguish from those of the
user. In addition, passive voice usually requires more words than active voice.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - After you install the software, start the computer.
     - After the software has been installed, the computer can be started.
   * - Click **OK** to save the configuration.
     - The configuration is saved when the **OK** button is clicked.
   * - Create a server.
     - A server is created by you.
   * - Rackspace products and services solve your business problems.
     - Your business problems are solved by Rackspace products and services.

```

However, passive voice is acceptable in the following situations:

- Using active voice sounds like you are blaming the customer. For example, you
  can use passive voice in an error message or troubleshooting content when the
  active subject is the customer.
- The agent of action is unknown, or you want to de-emphasize the agent of
  action and emphasize the object on which the action is performed.
- Recasting the sentence in active voice is wordy or awkward.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 33 33
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Acceptable
     - Avoid
     - Explanation
   * - If the build fails, the flavor might have been omitted.
     - If the build fails, you probably omitted the flavor.
     - The active voice blames the customer.
   * - A flag was set incorrectly.
     - You set the flag incorrectly.
     - The active voice blames the customer.
   * - Account owners cannot be assigned additional roles, and their access cannot be restricted.
     - Administrators cannot assign account owners additional roles, and they cannot restrict the access of account owners.
     - In this context, the object, account owners, is more important than the actor, administrators.

```

## Use present tense

Customers read documentation to perform tasks or gather information. For them,
these activities take place in their present, so the present tense is
appropriate in most cases. Additionally, present tense is easier to read than
past or future tense.

Use future tense only when you need to emphasize that something will occur
later (from the customers' perspective). To easily find and remove instances of
future tense, search for *will*.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - The product **prompts** you to verify the deletion.
     - The product **will prompt** you to verify the deletion.
   * - After you log in, your account **begins** the verification process.
     - After you log in, your account **will then begin** the verification process.
   * - To back up Cloud Sites to Cloud Files by using this example, you **create** two cron jobs. One job **backs up** the cloud site and database, and the second job **uploads** the backup to Cloud Files.
     - To back up Cloud Sites to Cloud Files by using this example, you **will need to create** two cron jobs. One cron job **will back up** the cloud site and database, and the second cron job **will upload** the backup to Cloud Files.
   * - Any customer with a Cloud account **can provision** multiple ServiceNet database instances.
     - Any customer with a Cloud account **will be able to provision** multiple ServiceNet database instances.
   * - When the contract changes, Rackspace **will notify** customers in release notes.
     - Not applicable. Future tense is appropriate in this example.

```

## Write to the user by using second person and imperative mood

Customers are more engaged with documentation when you use second person (that
is, you address the customer as *you*). Second person promotes a friendly tone
by addressing customers directly. Using second person with the imperative mood
(in which the subject *you* is understood) and active voice helps to eliminate
wordiness and confusion about who or what initiates an action, especially in
procedural steps.

Using second person also avoids the use of gender-specific, third-person
pronouns such as *he*, *she*, *his*, and *hers*. If you must use third person,
use the pronouns *they* and *their*, but ensure that the pronoun matches the
referenced noun in number.

Use first person plural pronouns (*we*, *our*) judiciously. These pronouns
emphasize the writer or Rackspace rather than the customer, so before you use
them, consider whether second person or imperative mood is more "user
friendly." However, use *we recommend* rather than *it is recommended* or
*Rackspace recommends*. Also, you can use *we* in the place of *Rackspace* if
necessary.

The first-person singular pronoun *I* is acceptable in the question part of
FAQs and when authors of blogs or signed articles are describing their own
actions or opinions.

Avoid switching person (point of view) in the same document. Switching person
is acceptable, however, in blog posts that use first-person singular but then
switch to second person for instructional steps.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50

   * - I want to update everyone about the current status of the project and our future plans. (from a blog post)
     - This post describes the current status of the project and future plans.

```

## Create short paragraphs

Short paragraphs are easier to scan and understand. Use the following
guidelines for paragraphs:
- Cover only one idea in each paragraph.
- Limit paragraphs to four to five sentences. However, avoid having
  one-sentence paragraphs.
- Use connective or transitional words to ensure flow within and between
  paragraphs.
- When listing three or more items, use a bullet list instead of embedding the
  items in a paragraph.

The following example shows how breaking up a long paragraph by using a list
makes it easy for the customer to scan the text.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - Within the Cloud Storage App for Microsoft SharePoint, you can delete a single file or multiple files from a container:

       
       - Delete a single file by clicking the delete icon to the right of the file's name.
      
       - Delete multiple files at one time by selecting the cloud icon to the left of each file's name and then clicking **Delete Selected**. Rows that you select for deletion are highlighted with a dark gray background.
       When you delete a file, it is permanently removed from the Cloud Files container.
     - Within the Cloud Storage App for Microsoft SharePoint, you can delete a single file or multiple files from a container. You can delete a single file by clicking the delete icon to the right of the file's name. You can delete multiple files at one time by selecting the cloud icon to the left of each file's name and then clicking Delete Selected. Rows that you select for deletion are highlighted with a dark gray background. When you delete a file, it is permanently removed from the Cloud Files container.

```

## Use short, familiar words and phrases
Use short, familiar words and phrases to convey an idea clearly. Such words and
phrases are more conversational, save space, are easier to scan, and are often
easier for non-native English speakers to understand. Use a longer word or
phrase only if necessary to convey a special meaning.

If a word has variant spellings that are equally acceptable (such as *canceled*
and *cancelled*), use the shorter spelling.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - Now we test on Python 2.7.x, but we plan to support Python 3.3.x.
     - At the current time we test on Python 2.7.x, but in the future we will fully support Python 3.3.x.
   * - This guide is designed to get you started with the service and to answer your questions about the service.
     - This guide is designed to get you up and running with the service and to answer any questions that you may have about the service.

```

## Use consistent terminology

Use words as they are defined in a general dictionary, in an accepted industry
dictionary or style guide, or for your particular project. Each word or phrase
should have only one meaning, and should be used consistently throughout the
documentation.

- Don't use the same word to describe two or more different concepts. For
  example, don't use *agent* to refer to both a person and a process.

- If a word has both a technical meaning and a general meaning, don't use it to
  express both meanings. Instead, use a synonym for the general meaning. For
  example, use *interface* as a noun that means user interface. Instead of also
  using *interface* as a verb, use *interact*.

- Don't use different words to mean the same thing. Standardize on the use of
  one word for a particular object. Technical writing is not creative writing,
  and you should not be concerned that you will bore customers with colorless
  prose. Clarity is the goal, so using a precise set of terms consistently is
  required. Following is a common example of multiple terms that refer to the
  same thing:
  - menu command *(the preferred term)*
  - menu item
  - menu option


- Use a word as only one part of speech. Many words can be correctly used as a
  verb and as a noun or an adjective, such as *display*. However, using the
  same word as more than one part of speech in the same document can be
  confusing to customers and translators, so avoid it when possible.

- Avoid fabricated words. Examples of fabricated words are *marketecture* or
  *edutainment*. Most such words are specific to a single business culture and
  are not understood in other cultures.

- Standardize words and spelling across a documentation set.

- Don't use terms with different meanings interchangeably. Some terms have
  similar but distinct meanings and should not be used interchangeably. For
  example:
  - environment, platform
  - version, release
  - panel, screen
  - window, dialog box

For guidelines about specific words, see [Terminology
guidelines](terminology-guidelines.md).

## Use simple action verbs, and don't turn them into nouns

Verbs carry the action in a sentence, and they make your documentation come
alive for customers. To make the biggest impact with your writing, use strong,
simple, action verbs, and use the guidelines in this section.

- [Use action-oriented verbs instead of weak
  verbs](#use-action-oriented-verbs-instead-of-weak-verbs)
- [Turn noun+verb constructions into verb-only
  constructions](#turn-noun-verb-constructions-into-verb-only-constructions)
- [Use the simplest tense](#use-the-simplest-tense)
- [Use helping verbs accurately](#use-helping-verbs-accurately)
- [Use single-word verbs](#use-single-word-verbs)
- [Do not use verbs as nouns or
  adjectives](#do-not-use-verbs-as-nouns-or-adjectives)
- [Do not use nonverbs as verbs](#do-not-use-nonverbs-as-verbs)
- [Use transitive verbs transitively, not
  intransitively](#use-transitive-verbs-transitively-not-intransitively)
- [Avoid using anthropomorphic verbs to describe inanimate
  objects](#avoid-using-anthropomorphic-verbs-to-describe-inanimate-objects)

### Use action-oriented verbs instead of weak verbs
When you use weak verbs like *be*, *have*, *make*, or *do* (and their
variants), or when you use gerunds (*-ing* words), nouns instead of verbs carry
the main action of the sentence. Shift the focus from nouns to verbs by
replacing weak verbs and gerunds with strong, action-oriented verbs. Relying on
verbs rather than nouns usually makes sentence shorter, clearer, and more
direct.

     - You create a server **by specifying** a name, flavor, and image.
   * - When you **create** a server, ...
     - When **creating** a server, ...

```

### Turn noun+verb constructions into verb-only constructions
Many nouns that we commonly use are built from verbs. When a verb is
transformed into a noun, the resulting noun is called a *nominalization*.
Sentences that include a nominalization and a verb can often be simplified by
changing the nominalization back into a verb and omitting the existing verb (as
shown in the following examples). Excessive and unnecessary use of
nominalizations contributes to wordiness and dilutes meaning. Omit them when
possible.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - The following table **describes** each of the products.

     - **Perform the installation** of the product by completing the following tasks.
   * - The program **encrypts** user IDs and passwords.
     - The program **enables the encryption of** user IDs and passwords.

```

### Use the simplest tense
Simple verbs, such as verbs in the present tense, are easier to read and
understand than complex verbs, such as verbs in the progressive or perfect
tense, or verbs combined with helping verbs (such as *can*, *may*, *might*,
*must*, and *should*).

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - Before you perform this task, **complete** the prerequisites.
     - Before you perform this task, you **should have completed** the prerequisites.
   * - To start, three ports **are** open: ssh, http, and https.
     - To start, you **are going to have** three ports open: ssh, http, and https.
   * - If you **use** a Red Hat distribution, iptables works a little differently.
     - If you **are using** a Red Hat distribution, iptables works a little differently.

```

### Use helping verbs accurately
If you need to use the following helping verbs, use them accurately and
consistently:
- **Can**: Use *can* to indicate the ability to perform an action.
- **May**: Use *may* to indicate permission.
- **Might**: Use *might* to indicate probability or possibility.
- **Must**: You can use *must* to indicate the necessity of an action. However,
  in general, use the imperative mood, which implies the subject you and does
  not require *must*, yet still indicates necessity.
- **Should**: Use *should* to tell customers what they *ought* to do. Because
  *should* implies uncertainty, avoid using it unless you explain further.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
   * - You **can** customize Cloud Queues to achieve a wide range of performance, durability, availability, and efficiency goals.
   * - If you need space, you **may** uninstall the program.
   * - A service **might** expose endpoints in different regions.
   * - The worker **must** delete the message when work is done.
   * - To avoid losing a claim in the middle of processing a message, clients **should** periodically renew claims during long-running batches of work.

```

### Use single-word verbs
When possible, use single-word verbs rather than phrasal verbs (verbs followed
by prepositions or adverbs). For example, use *omit* rather than *leave out*,
or shorten *start up* to *start*. One-word verbs are easier to understand and
to translate.

If you must use a phrasal verb, keep the parts of the verb together unless that
changes the meaning of the sentence. Some acceptable phrasal verbs are *back
up*, *log in*, *set up*, *shut down*, and *work around*.

**Note:** Do not turn a phrasal verb into a single-word verb. For example, do
not use *login*, *setup*, or *workaround* as verbs. These single-word terms
should be used only as nouns or adjectives.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - **Determine** the type of encryption (32-bit or 64-bit) that your computer uses.

     - **Click on** the link.
   * - You can safely **back up a database** by using Rackspace Cloud Backup.
     - You can safely **back a database up** by using Rackspace Cloud Backup.

```

### Do not use verbs as nouns or adjectives

If a word is defined in the dictionary as a verb, do not use it as a noun or
adjective. Some verbs that are commonly misused as nouns or adjectives are
*configure*, *compile*, *debug*, and *install*.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Correct
     - Incorrect
   * - After **installation** is completed, you can **configure** the product.
     - When you complete the **install**, you can begin the **configure**.
   * - After rubygems **is compiled**, the following message appears at the bottom of the output text.
     - When the **compile process** is finished, the following message appears at the bottom of the output text.

```

### Do not use nonverbs as verbs
Don't use nouns or adjectives as verbs, and do not add verb suffixes to
abbreviations, nouns, or conjunctions.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Correct
     - Incorrect
   * - You can **reorganize** the table space.
     - You can **REORG** the table space.
   * - Verify the change **by using the ping command** to contact the server.
     - Verify the change **by pinging** the server.
   * - Some databases and search engines **insert the AND operator** between adjacent words in a keyword search.
     - Some databases and search engines **AND** adjacent words in a keyword search.
   * - **Navigate** to the new directory.
     - **CD** to the new directory.

```

### Use transitive verbs transitively, not intransitively
Transitive verbs, such as *load*, *display*, *complete*, and *execute*, require
a direct object. Intransitive verbs do not require a direct object. Be sure to
use each type of verb correctly.

To avoid using a transitive verb intransitively, you can make it passive if the
performer of the action is understood or not important.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Correct
     - Incorrect
   * - The installation program **loads** the files. 
       *or* 
       The files **are loaded**.
     - The files **load**.
   * - The product **displays** the available servers in the right pane. 
       *or* 
       The available servers **are displayed** in the right pane.
     - The available servers **display** in the right pane.
   * - After the installation **is completed**, ensure that the FTP services are running.
     - After the installation **completes**, ensure that the FTP services are running.

```

### Avoid using anthropomorphic verbs to describe inanimate objects
Be careful not to ascribe human feelings, motivations, and actions to inanimate
objects. For example, a software program does not know, need, remember, see,
think, understand, or want. However, it can detect, record, require, store,
check, calculate, and process.

The following anthropomorphic verbs are acceptable in the computer industry:
accept, calculate, deny, detect, interact, interpret, listen, refuse, read, and
write.

```eval_rst

## Clarify gerunds and participles

Participles are verbs that end in *-ed* or *-ing* and act as modifiers. Gerunds
are verbs that end in *-ing* and act as nouns. Both types of words are useful
and acceptable, but confusion can arise if they are not placed precisely in a
sentence. For example, the word *meeting* can be a gerund or a modifier (or
even a noun) depending on its placement in a sentence. Clarify gerunds and
participles as necessary.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - A job can include **metadata that schedules** the program to run at a specified date and time.
     - A job can include **scheduling metadata** that enables the program to run at a specified date and time.
   * - Public Cloud is infrastructure **that consists of** shared resources, deployed on a self-service basis over the Internet.
     - Public Cloud is infrastructure **consisting of** shared resources, deployed on a self-service basis over the Internet.
   * - Test the certificate **by using** a browser to connect to your server.
     - Test the certificate **using** a browser to connect to your server.
   * - When **you use** a load balancer with a public-facing IP address, this address becomes the IP address of your website.
     - When **using** a load balancer with a public-facing IP address, this address becomes the IP address of your website.

```

The last example illustrates a dangling modifier. In the "Avoid" example,
*using* does not have a subject, so the implied subject is *address*, which is
incorrect. If the implied subject is not correct, you must revise the sentence
to provide a subject for the modifying phrase.

Gerunds are used to start headings for process topics. Ensure that their
meaning is not ambiguous.

Back up statements with solid, specific details. Do not sacrifice clarity and
completeness for brevity.

## Use interjections with care
An interjection is an emotional greeting or phrase, usually followed by an
exclamation point. For example, expressions such as *Hooray!*, *Excuse me!*,
*Sorry!*, *No thank you!*, *Oh dear!*, and *Hey, that's mine!* are
interjections.

In rare cases, an interjection might be appropriate. For example, at the end of
a procedure that targets *novice* customers, you might write, "Congratulations!
You successfully created your first cloud server."

However, because the tone of an interjection can be condescending, use them
sparingly and with care.

## Use restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses correctly
A restrictive clause is essential to the meaning of a sentence because it
limits the noun to which it refers. If you omit a restrictive clause, you
change the essential meaning of the sentence. You indicate a restrictive clause
with the relative pronoun *that* or *who*, and you do not set off a restrictive
clause with commas.

A nonrestrictive clause does not change the core meaning of the sentence. You
set off a nonrestrictive clause with commas and the relative pronouns *which*
or *who*.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Restrictive clause
     - Nonrestrictive clause
   * - He hired the man **who came from Kansas**. (Not the man from Idaho)
     - Jackhammers, **which are useful for breaking up concrete**, are on sale.
   * - Enter the user name and password **that you just created**. (Not the user name and password that you created last month)
     - The hourly backups are rolled into a nightly backup, **which is retained for two days**.

```

Be sure to clarify restrictive clauses, as follows:

- Include the relative pronoun (usually *that*). You can identify restrictive
  clauses in which that is missing by looking for two successive nouns.
- Do not substitute *which* for *that*.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - Enter the user name and password **that you just created**.
     - Enter the user name and password **you just created**. 

       Enter the user name and password **which you just created**.
   * - A task presents **information that a customer needs** to achieve a specific goal.
     - A task presents **information a customer needs** to achieve a specific goal. 

       A task presents **information which a customer needs** to achieve a specific goal.

```

## Clarify pronouns

Pronouns are useful, but you must ensure that their antecedents (the words that
they are used in place of) are clear, and that they (the pronouns) don’t
contribute to vagueness and ambiguity. The following pronouns often cause
problems, so use them carefully: *it*, *this*, *there*, and *that*.

### It
Ensure that the antecedent of *it* is clear. If multiple singular nouns precede
*it*, any of them could be the antecedent.

Avoid using *it is* to begin a sentence. Such a construction hides the real
subject of the sentence.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - You can store the value and use it again later.
     - The product stores the value in the configuration file. You can use it again later. (The antecedent of it could be the product, the value, or the file.)
   * - You must close all open windows before you run the script.
     - It is important that you close all open windows before you run the script.

```

### This
Avoid beginning a sentence with the pronoun *this*, unless you follow *this*
with a noun to clarify its meaning.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - This option causes an error when you run the program.
     - This causes an error when you run the program.

```

### There
Avoid using *there is* and *there are* as the subject of a sentence or clause.
Using *there* shifts the focus away from the real subject and often uses
unnecessary words.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - This option has no parameter 
       *or* 
       No parameter exists for this option.
     - There is no parameter for this option.
   * - When errors occur in the script, the product writes information to the message log.
     - When there are errors in the script, the product writes information to the message log.
   * - The Cloud Sites FTP service supports resumable uploading. If a connection fails during an upload, you do not need to restart the upload from the beginning.
     - The Cloud Sites FTP service supports resumable uploading. This means that if there is a connection failure during an upload, it does not have to be started from the beginning.

```

### That
Although you should use *that* as a relative pronoun (see [Use restrictive and
nonrestrictive clauses
correctly](#use-restrictive-and-nonrestrictive-clauses-correctly)), avoid using
it as a demonstrative pronoun (which stands in for or points to a noun).
Instead, use it as an adjective and follow it with a noun.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - Use that method.
     - That is the method to use.
   * - You can also edit or delete your CNAME by managing your DNS in your existing tool.
     - If you want to edit or delete your CNAME, you can also do that by managing your DNS in your existing tool.

```

## Include all necessary words
Include all the words that are necessary to make the meaning of a sentence
clear the first time it is read. Include all necessary articles (*a*, *an*,
*the*) and other syntactic cues, such as those described in [Clarify gerunds
and participles](#clarify-gerunds-and-participles), [Use restrictive and
nonrestrictive clauses
correctly](#use-restrictive-and-nonrestrictive-clauses-correctly), and [Clarify
pronouns](#clarify-pronouns).

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - Empty the file.
     - Empty file.
   * - The Label option is not supported for this file format.
     - Label option not supported for file format.

```

## Use positive statements
Positive statements are easier to understand than negative statements.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - The software works properly when installed correctly.
     - The software will not work properly unless you install it correctly.
   * - Remember to involve your business users in the scheduling process.
     - Do not forget to involve your business users in the scheduling process.
   * - Sometimes you want to prevent a search engine from indexing a website.
     - It is not uncommon in certain situations to not want to allow indexing of a site by a search engine.

```

Also, try to avoid the following negative words, using instead the suggested
alternatives. However, always be honest and transparent about any issues.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Avoid
     - Alternative
   * - damage
     - affect
   * - catastrophic
     - serious
   * - bad
     - Use *serious* or add an explanation
   * - fail
     - unable to
   * - kill
     - cancel
   * - fatal
     - serious
   * - destroy
     - remove
   * - wrong
     - incorrect, inconsistent

```

## Use consistent references to time, space, and versions
Use the following terms consistently:

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 33 33
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Terms
     - Usage
     - Examples

       **After** you save your document, you can print it.
   * - following, preceding
     - To locate an item in space 

       **Note:** Do not use *above*, *below*, *earlier*, *later*, *before*, or *after* as references to information in text. Where possible, use specific references. If you cannot make specific references, use *preceding* and *following* as adjectives for elements such as figures and tables.
     - The **preceding** information explains how to print a document correctly. 

       The utility analyzes the **following** information to prepare the report.
   * - earlier, later
     - To refer to product releases (version numbers). 

       **Note:** Do not use *higher*, *lower*, *above*, *below*, *older*, or *newer*.
     - The required namespace kernel features are not available in the default kernel shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4, CentOS 6.4, and **earlier** versions of these operating systems.

       Rackspace Private Cloud version 4.0 has not been tested on versions of Ubuntu **later** than 12.04.

```

## Use correct punctuation
When customers have to reread a sentence or paragraph to understand it, faulty
punctuation is often the culprit. Following are some common situations:
- A comma is omitted.
- An unnecessary comma is used.
- A long sentence contains overly complex punctuation.
- A parenthetical phrase occurs in the middle of an instruction.

All of these situations can inhibit comprehension. By using correct punctuation
in general, keeping sentences short, and using consistent punctuation in lists,
procedures, and tables, you help customers to understand what you mean *the
first time* they read the text. Following are a few basic guidelines to apply:

- Use a comma before the last item in a series (known as the *serial* comma).
- Use a comma to separate independent clauses, and be sure to include a
  coordinating conjunction.
- Avoid using semicolons to separate clauses. They can make long sentences seem
  even longer. You can almost always use a period in the place of a semicolon.
- Do not use a slash mark (/) to present a choice among, or a series of,
  actions or objects. Rewrite the phrase to eliminate the slash mark.
  Exceptions are established terms like *client/server* and *read/write*.

For additional specific punctuation guidelines and examples, see
[Punctuation](../m-z-style-guidelines.html#punctuation). For basic rules about
punctuation, see a grammar book, such as the *Harbrace College Handbook*.

**Note:** Avoid using exclamation points, question marks, ellipses (three
dots), or single quotation marks in text. Although these punctuation marks
might appear in code elements, messages, literal commands, or UIs, they are
rarely useful when writing descriptions or instructions for customers. One
exception is the use of question marks in FAQ topics.

## Avoid obscure non-English words and abbreviations
Some non-English words and abbreviations are difficult to translate, and some
customers might be unfamiliar with them. Some Latin abbreviations, like *i.e.*,
*e.g.*, and *etc.*, are unnecessarily vague. The following table lists terms
and abbreviations to avoid, and their preferred alternatives.

```eval_rst

## Write for a global audience
Rackspace is a global company, with customers in many countries. A small amount
of content has been translated, but most has not, which means that many
customers who do not speak English as their first language consume our English
content. All of the guidelines in this topic ("Basic writing guidelines") are
designed to make content easy to understand for all audiences, but the
following guidelines will especially clarify content for global audiences.

- [Do not use idioms or colloquialisms](#do-not-use-idioms-or-colloquialisms)
- [Avoid metaphorical terms](#avoid-metaphorical-terms)
- [Do not use humor](#do-not-use-humor)
- [Use jargon carefully](#use-jargon-carefully)
- [Use culture-neutral language and
  examples](#use-culture-neutral-language-and-examples)
- [Use culture-neutral graphics](#use-culture-neutral-graphics)
- [Avoid abbreviated date formats](#avoid-abbreviated-date-formats)

### Do not use idioms or colloquialisms
An *idiom* is an expression whose meaning cannot be derived from the literal
meaning of the individual words. Some examples are *in a nutshell*, *the bottom
line*, *across the board*, and *on the fly*.

A *colloquialism* is an expression considered more appropriate to familiar and
casual conversation than to formal speech or to formal writing. Although we
might like to establish a more conversational tone in some content,
colloquialisms can be hard for non-native English speakers to understand, and
they are hard to translate.

Avoid idioms and colloquialisms as often as possible.

The following table lists some idioms and colloquialisms, and provides
alternatives that you can use. Note that the alternative terms are generally
shorter than their idiomatic or colloquial counterparts.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Idiom or colloquialism
     - Alternative
   * - for the most part

     - consider, remember
   * - keep an eye out for
     - look for
   * - figure out
     - determine
   * - stand for
     - represent
   * - come across
     - encounter
   * - fine tune
     - refine, customize
   * - get a feel for
     - become familiar with
   * - in light of
     - because of
   * - set aside
     - defer, allocate
   * - kind of like
     - similar to
   * - lots of
     - many
   * - what's more
     - moreover
   * - a hair smaller than
     - slightly smaller than
   * - when you are done
     - when you are finished

```

### Avoid metaphorical terms
A *metaphor* is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase that denotes one
kind of object or action is used in place of another to suggest a likeness or
analogy between them. Although some common metaphors are easy even for people
who do not speak English as a first language, avoid them as often as possible.

The following table provides some examples of metaphorical terms that can
easily be replaced with one or more words.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Metaphor
     - Alternative
   * - a handful of companies
     - a few companies
   * - table a discussion
     - postpone a discussion
   * - the vanilla model
     - the standard model
   * - avoid common pitfalls
     - avoid common problems
   * - the drawback of frequent updates
     - the disadvantage of frequent updates

```

### Do not use humor
Humor is culture specific. What might be funny in one culture might be
offensive or obscene in another culture. Humor doesn't translate well,
literally or figuratively, so don't use it.

### Use jargon carefully
*Jargon* is the specialized language of a profession. Jargon can be useful for
technical audiences, but it can be meaningless to novice customers and
difficult to translate. Do not use jargon if you can easily and correctly use a
more common or familiar term, or if the jargon obfuscates rather than clarifies
the meaning. However, if the jargon is essential to the technical meaning of
the content, use it. If the audience is not highly technical, consider
explaining any jargon that you use.

The following table lists some jargon typically used in the high tech industry
and some possible alternatives.

**Use with Caution:** This list is under construction as we determine what
jargon is acceptable. If one of these terms is used in content that is provided
by support or development, determine whether it is appropriate for the
audience.

```

### Use culture-neutral language and examples
Cultural references and examples in your documentation can cause problems for a
global audience and for translation. Sounds, colors, animals, gestures, events,
and symbols do not convey the same meaning in every culture.

- Do not use the names of places, public figures, or holidays. If you must, use
  examples that represent a variety of cultures or that are internationally
  recognized. For example, use international cities, such as Paris, New York,
  Tokyo, London, and Hong Kong.

- Do not use political, religious, ethnic, or historical references.

- Do not use metaphors that are specific to one culture (for example, an
  American football metaphor).

Use generic examples that work in any target market.

If you create "named" users for extended examples or scenarios, use names that
represent a variety of ethnic backgrounds, genders, and locations.

### Use culture-neutral graphics
Use graphics whenever possible to present processes and complex ideas. However,
be aware of the following possible issues:

- Some customers do not typically read from left to right. If a graphics
  illustrates a sequence, make that sequence explicit by using numbers, arrows,
  or directional terms.

- Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning. The color red, for example, has
  different meanings in different countries so could be interpreted differently
  by different customers. Also, colors can have political or religious
  significance. Use neutral colors as often as possible.

- Do not use a picture of a hand by itself (for example, a hand that is
  pointing). Almost every hand gesture is offensive to someone. A picture of a
  hand that is holding an item or interacting with something is generally
  acceptable.

- Use generic or international images. Some examples are soccer players and
  equipment, generic landscapes, pens and pencils, and generic images of
  computer equipment. Avoid using images of men, women, flags, maps, animals,
  alcohol, trendy objects, historical references, or film, cartoon, or video
  characters.

### Avoid abbreviated date formats
Date formats vary among cultures. Write out dates, unless you are showing a
literal representation as it is displayed in the software or you need to use an
abbreviation in a table or figure. If you use abbreviations, include an
explanation and use the abbreviated format consistently.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Use
     - Avoid
   * - August 12, 2012
     - 8/12/2012
       
       8-12-12

```

For more guidance about writing dates, see
[Dates](../a-l-style-guidelines.html#dates).
